The harmonised rules laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with the New Legislative Framework, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, in particular on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment, and protection of workers, and product safety, to which this Regulation is complementary. As a consequence, all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers, and other persons on whom AI systems may have a negative impact, including as regards the compensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive 85/374/EEC (10) remain unaffected and fully applicable. Furthermore, in the context of employment and protection of workers, this Regulation should therefore not affect Union law on social policy and national labour law, in compliance with Union law, concerning employment and working conditions, including health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers.

This Regulation should not affect the provisions aiming to improve working conditions in platform work laid down in a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving working conditions in platform work. Moreover, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such existing rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations, including in respect of the transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI systems.

For example, national labour law and law on the protection of minors, namely persons below the age of 18, taking into account the UNCRC General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights in relation to the digital environment, insofar as they are not specific to AI systems and pursue other legitimate public interest objectives, should not be affected by this Regulation.\",\n    'dma': \"Given the potential significant societal effects of an infringement of the additional obligations to manage systemic risks that solely apply to very large online platforms and very large online search engines and in order to address those public policy concerns, it is necessary to provide for a system of enhanced supervision of any action undertaken to effectively terminate and remedy infringements of this Regulation.

Such notification may result in an intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation. (88) In setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches, due consideration should be given to the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not personal data had been protected by appropriate technical protection measures, effectively limiting the likelihood of identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules and procedures should take into account the legitimate interests of law-enforcement authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation of the circumstances of a personal data breach. (89) Directive 95/46/EC provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data to the supervisory authorities. While that obligation produces administrative and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection of personal data.\nReference answer: Under the GDPR, data controllers are required to report data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.

(175) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (56). (176) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to improve the functioning of the internal market and to promote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy AI, while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection against harmful effects of AI systems in the Union and supporting innovation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\nReference answer: The AI Act aims to ensure that AI systems placed on the market and used in the Union are safe, respect existing law on fundamental rights and Union values, and do not undermine fundamental rights.

The identification of those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems that the Commission should be empowered to adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of technological development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems. (53) It is also important to clarify that there may be specific cases in which AI systems referred to in pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant risk of harm to the legal interests protected under those areas because they do not materially influence the decision-making or do not harm those interests substantially. For the purposes of this Regulation, an AI system that does not materially influence the outcome of decision-making should be understood to be an AI system that does not have an impact on the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether human or automated.\nReference answer: The AI Act classifies AI systems based on the risk they pose and subjects high-risk AI systems to strict requirements. High-risk AI systems include those used in critical infrastructure, education, employment, essential public and private services, law enforcement, and migration, asylum, and border control management. These systems must comply with requirements related to risk management, data governance, technical documentation, record-keeping, transparency, provision of information to users, human oversight, accuracy, and robustness.

Those rules should be consistent with the Charter, non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments. They should also take into account the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade and the Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG). (8) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. Those rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights, supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling a European ecosystem of public and private actors creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the Union.\nReference answer: The AI Act incorporates several measures to protect fundamental rights, such as requiring AI systems to be designed and used in a manner that is consistent with respect for human dignity, privacy, non-discrimination, and other fundamental rights. This includes embedding human oversight mechanisms, ensuring that AI systems do not lead to biased or discriminatory outcomes, and providing avenues for individuals to contest decisions made by AI systems that affect them significantly. The Act also promotes the development of codes of conduct and voluntary measures by providers to ensure that AI is used ethically and in alignment with societal values.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8970\nSemantic Similarity: 0.6975\n----\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"f8ca007d320b4ac5a656484bdaf6b6cb"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"7b0d586669af46da8e681b14d47bf6e4"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Query: What categories of AI systems are considered high-risk under the AI Act?\nRetrieved chunk 48 from AI_ACT:\nRetrieved text: (52) As regards stand-alone AI systems, namely high-risk AI systems other than those that are safety components of products, or that are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk if, in light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of specifically pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation.

To that end, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary competence, training and authority to carry out that role. It is also essential, as appropriate, to ensure that high-risk AI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a natural person to whom human oversight has been assigned to make informed decisions if, when and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, or stop the system if it does not perform as intended. Considering the significant consequences for persons in the case of an incorrect match by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to provide for an enhanced human oversight requirement for those systems so that no action or decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons. Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person operating or using the system.\nReference answer: The AI Act imposes strict regulations on the use of biometric identification systems, particularly those used in public spaces for law enforcement purposes. The use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces is generally prohibited, with exceptions granted under specific conditions, such as preventing a terrorist attack, locating a missing child, or identifying a suspect of a serious crime. Even in these cases, the use must be authorized by judicial or other independent authorities, and subject to strict safeguards to protect fundamental rights.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8842\nSemantic Similarity: 0.6117\n----\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"6e18e83ee17444ee986faafd02c15b9e"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"b425f8aefef544c1a9aacc399a267e65"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Query: What are the requirements for conformity assessments under the AI Act?\nRetrieved chunk 240 from AI_ACT:\nRetrieved text: For high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I, the provider shall follow the relevant conformity assessment procedure as required under those legal acts.

The data must be carefully selected to avoid biases that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. Providers must ensure that the data governance framework includes measures to assess and mitigate risks related to data quality, such as using diverse and representative datasets, validating the accuracy and reliability of data, and regularly updating datasets to reflect changes over time.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8736\nSemantic Similarity: 0.5224\n----\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"aac947fbe7b446969fbccf1cccdd03e0"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"511bdcb3f7c847ab8fa348065fa3067c"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Query: How does the AI Act regulate the use of AI in law enforcement and public safety?\nRetrieved chunk 58 from AI_ACT:\nRetrieved text: (59) Given their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving certain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the AI system is not trained with high-quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, explainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems intended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and transparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and ensure accountability and effective redress.\nReference answer: The AI Act imposes strict regulations on the use of AI systems in law enforcement and public safety, particularly those used for predictive policing, biometric identification, and surveillance. These systems are considered high-risk and are subject to rigorous scrutiny to ensure that they do not infringe on fundamental rights, such as privacy and non-discrimination. Law enforcement agencies must conduct a detailed risk assessment and implement safeguards to ensure that the use of AI systems is necessary, proportionate, and respectful of human rights.\nCosine Similarity: 0.9303\nSemantic Similarity: 0.8034\n----\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"706a3c06c26e4d6da99b31638467a34b"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"8228ea346961409eb1d719cd4ff4d8d3"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Query: How does the AI Act address the issue of bias and discrimination in AI systems?\nRetrieved chunk 69 from AI_ACT:\nRetrieved text: The data sets should also have the appropriate statistical properties, including as regards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high-risk AI system is intended to be used, with specific attention to the mitigation of possible biases in the data sets, that are likely to affect the health and safety of persons, have a negative impact on fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future operations (feedback loops). Biases can for example be inherent in underlying data sets, especially when historical data is being used, or generated when the systems are implemented in real world settings. Results provided by AI systems could be influenced by such inherent biases that are inclined to gradually increase and thereby perpetuate and amplify existing discrimination, in particular for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups, including racial or ethnic groups. The requirement for the data sets to be to the best extent possible complete and free of errors should not affect the use of privacy-preserving techniques in the context of the development and testing of AI systems. In particular, data sets should take into account, to the extent required by their intended purpose, the features, characteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, contextual, behavioural or functional setting which the AI system is intended to be used.\nReference answer: The AI Act mandates that AI systems, particularly high-risk ones, be designed and developed in a manner that prevents, identifies, and mitigates biases that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. Providers must take measures to ensure that AI systems do not produce results that unfairly disadvantage individuals or groups based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, or religion.

(47) AI systems could have an adverse impact on the health and safety of persons, in particular when such systems operate as safety components of products. Consistent with the objectives of Union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their way into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product as a whole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and mitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and performs their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics systems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate. (48) The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights protected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI system as high risk.\nReference answer: The AI Act recognizes the potential benefits of AI in healthcare, such as improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. However, it also acknowledges the risks associated with the use of AI in this sensitive sector. AI systems used in healthcare, particularly those that involve decision-making or provide recommendations to healthcare professionals, are classified as high-risk and are subject to strict requirements. These include ensuring the accuracy and reliability of AI systems, maintaining human oversight, and safeguarding patient data.

In the context of the application this Regulation, AI literacy should provide all relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights required to ensure the appropriate compliance and its correct enforcement. Furthermore, the wide implementation of AI literacy measures and the introduction of appropriate follow-up actions could contribute to improving working conditions and ultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation path of trustworthy AI in the Union. The European Artificial Intelligence Board (the ‘Board’) should support the Commission, to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding of the benefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems. In cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, the Commission and the Member States should facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to advance AI literacy among persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI.\nReference answer: The AI Act encourages initiatives to promote AI literacy and public awareness, recognizing that informed and educated citizens are essential for the responsible adoption of AI technologies. The Act calls for the development of educational programs and resources to help individuals understand the capabilities, limitations, and risks associated with AI.

The Act emphasizes the importance of human-centric AI, where AI systems are designed to enhance human capabilities and well-being while respecting human dignity and autonomy. It also supports the creation of regulatory sandboxes to allow developers to experiment with innovative AI solutions in a controlled environment, ensuring that ethical considerations are integrated into the design and deployment of AI technologies.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8928\nSemantic Similarity: 0.7091\n----\n\n\nQuerying DMA collection:\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"1c75fabb2d4f48d09a3ab04e695468c6"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"38f5db7d48fc4493844e67b914e0ea18"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Query: What criteria are used to define a 'gatekeeper' under the Digital Markets Act?\nRetrieved chunk 2 from DMA:\nRetrieved text: (3) Responsible and diligent behaviour by providers of intermediary services is essential for a safe, predictable and trustworthy online environment and for allowing Union citizens and other persons to exercise their fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’), in particular the freedom of expression and of information, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to non-discrimination and the attainment of a high level of consumer protection. (4) Therefore, in order to safeguard and improve the functioning of the internal market, a targeted set of uniform, effective and proportionate mandatory rules should be established at Union level. This Regulation provides the conditions for innovative digital services to emerge and to scale up in the internal market. The approximation of national regulatory measures at Union level concerning the requirements for providers of intermediary services is necessary to avoid and put an end to fragmentation of the internal market and to ensure legal certainty, thus reducing uncertainty for developers and fostering interoperability.

For example, the comments section in an online newspaper could constitute such a feature, where it is clear that it is ancillary to the main service represented by the publication of news under the editorial responsibility of the publisher. In contrast, the storage of comments in a social network should be considered an online platform service where it is clear that it is not a minor feature of the service offered, even if it is ancillary to publishing the posts of recipients of the service. For the purposes of this Regulation, cloud computing or web-hosting services should not be considered to be an online platform where dissemination of specific information to the public constitutes a minor and ancillary feature or a minor functionality of such services.\nReference answer: Core platform services under the DMA include a range of digital services that serve as important gateways for business users to reach end users. These services include online intermediation services, such as app stores and marketplaces, online search engines, social networking services, video-sharing platform services, number-independent interpersonal communication services, operating systems, cloud computing services, and advertising services.

(14) The concept of ‘dissemination to the public’, as used in this Regulation, should entail the making available of information to a potentially unlimited number of persons, meaning making the information easily accessible to recipients of the service in general without further action by the recipient of the service providing the information being required, irrespective of whether those persons actually access the information in question. Accordingly, where access to information requires registration or admittance to a group of recipients of the service, that information should be considered to be disseminated to the public only where recipients of the service seeking to access the information are automatically registered or admitted without a human decision or selection of whom to grant access. Interpersonal communication services, as defined in Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council (24), such as emails or private messaging services, fall outside the scope of the definition of online platforms as they are used for interpersonal communication between a finite number of persons determined by the sender of the communication.\nReference answer: The DMA ensures that end users have access to core platform services on fair and non-discriminatory terms. Gatekeepers are prohibited from restricting or degrading the quality of access to their services or from engaging in practices that limit user choice, such as forcing users to install certain apps or use specific services. The DMA also promotes data portability, allowing end users to transfer their data to other services and take advantage of competitive offerings.

Complaints could provide a faithful overview of concerns related to a particular intermediary service provider’s compliance and could also inform the Digital Services Coordinator of any more cross-cutting issues. The Digital Services Coordinator should involve other national competent authorities as well as the Digital Services Coordinator of another Member State, and in particular the one of the Member State where the provider of intermediary services concerned is established, if the issue requires cross-border cooperation. (119) Member States should ensure that Digital Services Coordinators can take measures that are effective in addressing and proportionate to certain particularly serious and persistent infringements of this Regulation. Especially where those measures can affect the rights and interests of third parties, as may be the case in particular where the access to online interfaces is restricted, it is appropriate to require that the measures are subject to additional safeguards.\nReference answer: The European Commission is responsible for enforcing the DMA, including monitoring compliance, conducting investigations, and imposing penalties for non-compliance. The Commission has the authority to impose fines, periodic penalty payments, and structural remedies on gatekeepers that violate the DMA's obligations and prohibitions. The Commission also has the power to initiate market investigations to assess whether new services should be designated as core platform services or whether additional obligations should be imposed on gatekeepers.

Those harmonised due diligence obligations, which should be reasonable and non-arbitrary, are needed to address the identified public policy concerns, such as safeguarding the legitimate interests of the recipients of the service, addressing illegal practices and protecting the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter. The due diligence obligations are independent from the question of liability of providers of intermediary services which need therefore to be assessed separately. (42) In order to facilitate smooth and efficient two-way communications, including, where relevant, by acknowledging the receipt of such communications, relating to matters covered by this Regulation, providers of intermediary services should be required to designate a single electronic point of contact and to publish and update relevant information relating to that point of contact, including the languages to be used in such communications. The electronic point of contact can also be used by trusted flaggers and by professional entities which are under a specific relationship with the provider of intermediary services.\nReference answer: Under the DSA, online platforms are responsible for taking effective measures to mitigate risks related to illegal content, ensure the safety of users, and protect fundamental rights.

Those additional obligations on providers of very large online platforms and of very large online search engines are necessary to address those public policy concerns, there being no alternative and less restrictive measures that would effectively achieve the same result. (76) Very large online platforms and very large online search engines may cause societal risks, different in scope and impact from those caused by smaller platforms. Providers of such very large online platforms and of very large online search engines should therefore bear the highest standard of due diligence obligations, proportionate to their societal impact. Once the number of active recipients of an online platform or of active recipients of an online search engine, calculated as an average over a period of six months, reaches a significant share of the Union population, the systemic risks the online platform or online search engine poses may have a disproportionate impact in the Union. Such significant reach should be considered to exist where such number exceeds an operational threshold set at 45 million, that is, a number equivalent to 10 % of the Union population. This operational threshold should be kept up to date and therefore the Commission should be empowered to supplement the provisions of this Regulation by adopting delegated acts, where necessary.\nReference answer: VLOPs, defined as platforms with more than 45 million users in the EU, have additional obligations under the DSA due to their significant impact on society and public discourse. VLOPs must conduct annual risk assessments to identify and mitigate systemic risks, such as the dissemination of illegal content, disinformation, and harmful content. They are also required to provide greater transparency in their content recommendation algorithms, offer users more control over the content they see, and cooperate with authorities to prevent and address systemic risks.

(65) In view of the particular responsibilities and obligations of providers of online platforms, they should be made subject to transparency reporting obligations, which apply in addition to the transparency reporting obligations applicable to all providers of intermediary services under this Regulation. For the purposes of determining whether online platforms and online search engines may be very large online platforms or very large online search engines, respectively, that are subject to certain additional obligations under this Regulation, the transparency reporting obligations for online platforms and online search engines should include certain obligations relating to the publication and communication of information on the average monthly active recipients of the service in the Union.\nReference answer: The DSA imposes transparency obligations on online platforms to provide clear and accessible information about how their algorithms work, particularly those used for content moderation, recommendation, and ranking. Platforms must explain the criteria and logic behind their algorithms, allowing users to understand how decisions are made and how content is presented to them. VLOPs have additional obligations to conduct algorithmic audits and to allow independent researchers to assess the impact of their algorithms on society. These transparency measures are intended to increase accountability and trust in the digital ecosystem.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8691\nSemantic Similarity: 0.5471\n----\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"1709ada281404ac881e74505afa22b45"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"267687ff80d84f8fbc45311c003b00bd"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Query: How does the DSA address the issue of disinformation and fake news on digital platforms?\nRetrieved chunk 71 from DSA:\nRetrieved text: When assessing the systemic risks identified in this Regulation, those providers should also focus on the information which is not illegal, but contributes to the systemic risks identified in this Regulation. Such providers should therefore pay particular attention on how their services are used to disseminate or amplify misleading or deceptive content, including disinformation. Where the algorithmic amplification of information contributes to the systemic risks, those providers should duly reflect this in their risk assessments. Where risks are localised or there are linguistic differences, those providers should also account for this in their risk assessments. Providers of very large online platforms and of very large online search engines should, in particular, assess how the design and functioning of their service, as well as the intentional and, oftentimes, coordinated manipulation and use of their services, or the systemic infringement of their terms of service, contribute to such risks. Such risks may arise, for example, through the inauthentic use of the service, such as the creation of fake accounts, the use of bots or deceptive use of a service, and other automated or partially automated behaviours, which may lead to the rapid and widespread dissemination to the public of information that is illegal content or incompatible with an online platform’s or online search engine's terms and conditions and that contributes to disinformation campaigns.\nReference answer: The DSA requires platforms, particularly VLOPs, to take proactive measures to combat the spread of disinformation and fake news. This includes implementing mechanisms to detect, assess, and mitigate the risks associated with disinformation, collaborating with independent fact-checkers, and providing users with accurate information and context. Platforms must also ensure that their content moderation and recommendation systems do not amplify or promote disinformation.

To avoid diminishing the added value of such mechanism, the overall number of trusted flaggers awarded in accordance with this Regulation should be limited. In particular, industry associations representing their members' interests are encouraged to apply for the status of trusted flaggers, without prejudice to the right of private entities or individuals to enter into bilateral agreements with the providers of online platforms. (62) Trusted flaggers should publish easily comprehensible and detailed reports on notices submitted in accordance with this Regulation. Those reports should indicate information such as the number of notices categorised by the provider of hosting services, the type of content, and the action taken by the provider. Given that trusted flaggers have demonstrated expertise and competence, the processing of notices submitted by trusted flaggers can be expected to be less burdensome and therefore faster compared to notices submitted by other recipients of the service.\nReference answer: The DSA recognizes the role of trusted flaggers—entities with expertise in identifying illegal content—as important partners in content moderation. Trusted flaggers are granted priority in the notice-and-action mechanisms, meaning that their reports are processed more quickly and with higher accuracy. Platforms must ensure that trusted flaggers' reports are handled by experienced moderators and that they receive feedback on the actions taken. The designation of trusted flaggers is intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of content moderation, particularly in combating illegal content and harmful activities online.\nCosine Similarity: 0.9100\nSemantic Similarity: 0.7025\n----\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"e566693cfcfe477d966ec595dec12ea5"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"a9e6502c5f474608920cb587d1cae503"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Query: How does the DSA promote the accountability of online platforms?\nRetrieved chunk 53 from DSA:\nRetrieved text: (66) In order to ensure transparency and to enable scrutiny over the content moderation decisions of the providers of online platforms and monitoring the spread of illegal content online, the Commission should maintain and publish a database which contains the decisions and statements of reasons of the providers of online platforms when they remove or otherwise restrict availability of and access to information.

Providers of online platforms should therefore be prohibited from deceiving or nudging recipients of the service and from distorting or impairing the autonomy, decision-making, or choice of the recipients of the service via the structure, design or functionalities of an online interface or a part thereof.\nReference answer: The DSA promotes accountability by imposing rigorous reporting and transparency requirements on online platforms. Platforms must publish regular transparency reports detailing their content moderation activities, including the number of removal actions, reasons for removals, and outcomes of user appeals. VLOPs are also required to undergo independent audits of their content moderation and risk management practices.

Therefore, there is a need to put in place appropriate, proportionate and effective safeguards against such misuse, that need to respect the rights and legitimate interests of all parties involved, including the applicable fundamental rights and freedoms as enshrined in the Charter, in particular the freedom of expression. Information should be considered to be manifestly illegal content and notices or complaints should be considered manifestly unfounded where it is evident to a layperson, without any substantive analysis, that the content is illegal or, respectively, that the notices or complaints are unfounded. (64) Under certain conditions, providers of online platforms should temporarily suspend their relevant activities in respect of the person engaged in abusive behaviour. This is without prejudice to the freedom by providers of online platforms to determine their terms and conditions and establish stricter measures in the case of manifestly illegal content related to serious crimes, such as child sexual abuse material.

The Commission and the Board should aim that the codes of conduct clearly define the nature of the public interest objectives being addressed, that they contain mechanisms for independent evaluation of the achievement of those objectives and that the role of relevant authorities is clearly defined. Particular attention should be given to avoiding negative effects on security, the protection of privacy and personal data, as well as to the prohibition on imposing general monitoring obligations. While the implementation of codes of conduct should be measurable and subject to public oversight, this should not impair the voluntary nature of such codes and the freedom of interested parties to decide whether to participate. In certain circumstances, it is important that very large online platforms cooperate in the drawing-up and adhere to specific codes of conduct.\nReference answer: The DSA encourages the development of codes of conduct for online platforms to address specific issues such as content moderation, algorithmic transparency, and the protection of minors.
