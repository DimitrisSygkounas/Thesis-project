This should apply in particular to the processing of personal data in the audiovisual field and in news archives and press libraries. Therefore, Member States should adopt legislative measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations necessary for the purpose of balancing those fundamental rights. Member States should adopt such exemptions and derogations on general principles, the rights of the data subject, the controller and the processor, the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations, the independent supervisory authorities, cooperation and consistency, and specific data-processing situations. Where such exemptions or derogations differ from one Member State to another, the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject should apply. In order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly.\",\n    'ai_act': \"Harmonised rules applicable to the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of high-risk AI systems should be laid down consistently with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) (New Legislative Framework). The harmonised rules laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with the New Legislative Framework, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, in particular on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment, and protection of workers, and product safety, to which this Regulation is complementary. As a consequence, all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers, and other persons on whom AI systems may have a negative impact, including as regards the compensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive 85/374/EEC (10) remain unaffected and fully applicable. Furthermore, in the context of employment and protection of workers, this Regulation should therefore not affect Union law on social policy and national labour law, in compliance with Union law, concerning employment and working conditions, including health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers. This Regulation should also not affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and at Union level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other action covered by the specific industrial relations systems in Member States as well as the right to negotiate, to conclude and enforce collective agreements or to take collective action in accordance with national law. This Regulation should not affect the provisions aiming to improve working conditions in platform work laid down in a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving working conditions in platform work. Moreover, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such existing rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations, including in respect of the transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various operators involved in the AI value chain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national law, in compliance with Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems where such law falls outside the scope of this Regulation or pursues legitimate public interest objectives other than those pursued by this Regulation. For example, national labour law and law on the protection of minors, namely persons below the age of 18, taking into account the UNCRC General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights in relation to the digital environment, insofar as they are not specific to AI systems and pursue other legitimate public interest objectives, should not be affected by this Regulation.\",\n    'dma': \"Given the potential significant societal effects of an infringement of the additional obligations to manage systemic risks that solely apply to very large online platforms and very large online search engines and in order to address those public policy concerns, it is necessary to provide for a system of enhanced supervision of any action undertaken to effectively terminate and remedy infringements of this Regulation. Therefore, once an infringement of one of the provisions of this Regulation that solely apply to very large online platforms or very large online search engines has been ascertained and, where necessary, sanctioned, the Commission should request the provider of such platform or of such search engine to draw a detailed action plan to remedy any effect of the infringement for the future and communicate such action plan within a timeline set by the Commission, to the Digital Services Coordinators, the Commission and the Board. The Commission, taking into account the opinion of the Board, should establish whether the measures included in the action plan are sufficient to address the infringement, taking also into account whether adherence to relevant code of conduct is included among the measures proposed. The Commission should also monitor any subsequent measure taken by the provider of a very large online platform or of a very large online search engine concerned as set out in its action plan, taking into account also an independent audit of the provider. If following the implementation of the action plan the Commission still considers that the infringement has not been fully remedied, or if the action plan has not been provided or is not considered suitable, it should be able to use any investigative or enforcement powers pursuant to this Regulation, including the power to impose periodic penalty payments and initiating the procedure to disable access to the infringing service.\",\n    'dsa': \"Considering the particular characteristics of the services concerned and the corresponding need to make the providers thereof subject to certain specific obligations, it is necessary to distinguish, within the broader category of providers of hosting services as defined in this Regulation, the subcategory of online platforms. Online platforms, such as social networks or online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders, should be defined as providers of hosting services that not only store information provided by the recipients of the service at their request, but that also disseminate that information to the public at the request of the recipients of the service. However, in order to avoid imposing overly broad obligations, providers of hosting services should not be considered as online platforms where the dissemination to the public is merely a minor and purely ancillary feature that is intrinsically linked to another service, or a minor functionality of the principal service, and that feature or functionality cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without that other or principal service, and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to circumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation applicable to online platforms. For example, the comments section in an online newspaper could constitute such a feature, where it is clear that it is ancillary to the main service represented by the publication of news under the editorial responsibility of the publisher. In contrast, the storage of comments in a social network should be considered an online platform service where it is clear that it is not a minor feature of the service offered, even if it is ancillary to publishing the posts of recipients of the service. For the purposes of this Regulation, cloud computing or web-hosting services should not be considered to be an online platform where dissemination of specific information to the public constitutes a minor and ancillary feature or a minor functionality of such services.Moreover, cloud computing services and web-hosting services, when serving as infrastructure, such as the underlying infrastructural storage and computing services of an internet-based application, website or online platform, should not in themselves be considered as disseminating to the public information stored or processed at the request of a recipient of the application, website or online platform which they host.\"\n}\n\n# Function to search in Weaviate\ndef search_weaviate(query_embedding, class_name, top_k=1):\n    result = client.query \\\n        .get(class_name, [\"text\", \"_additional {distance}\"]) \\\n        .with_near_vector({\"vector\": query_embedding, \"certainty\": 0.7}) \\\n        .with_limit(top_k) \\\n        .do()\n    \n    if 'data' in result and 'Get' in result['data'] and class_name in result['data']['Get']:\n        return [(res['text'], res['_additional']['distance']) for res in result['data']['Get'][class_name]]\n    else:\n        return []\n\n\nfor law, info in laws_info.items():\n    print(f\"\\nQuerying {law.upper()} collection:\")\n    \n    # Generate query embedding using SentenceTransformer model\n    query_embedding = embedding_model.encode([info['query']], convert_to_tensor=False)[0]\n    \n    # Retrieve results from Weaviate\n    search_results = search_weaviate(query_embedding, info['class_name'], top_k=1)\n\n    if search_results:\n        retrieved_context, distance = search_results[0]  # Get the top result\n\n        # Generate embeddings using BERT for cosine similarity\n        retrieved_embedding = generate_bert_embedding(retrieved_context, tokenizer, bert_model)\n        reference_embedding = generate_bert_embedding(reference_answers[law], tokenizer, bert_model)\n\n        # Calculate cosine similarity\n        cosine_sim = calculate_cosine_similarity(reference_embedding, retrieved_embedding)\n\n        # Calculate semantic similarity using SentenceTransformer model\n        semantic_sim = calculate_semantic_similarity(reference_answers[law], retrieved_context, semantic_model)\n\n        # Print the results for this law\n        print(f\"Retrieved chunk from {law.upper()}:\")\n        print(retrieved_context)\n        print(f\"Cosine Similarity with reference answer: {cosine_sim:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"Semantic Similarity with reference answer: {semantic_sim:.4f}\")\n        print(\"----\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No valid results found for {law.upper()} in the query.\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-19T11:14:03.829515Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-19T11:14:03.829906Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-19T11:14:16.560837Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-19T11:14:03.829874Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-19T11:14:16.559995Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nQuerying GDPR collection:\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"c7dba72dc471489fa30ae7311b16fc8d"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"6425846439d542d9b0767438a4c61123"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"31678b166fb844d896ecdf771d35d6ba"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"Retrieved chunk from GDPR:\n(152)\nWhere this Regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in other cases, for example in cases of serious infringements of this Regulation, Member States should implement a system which provides for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
