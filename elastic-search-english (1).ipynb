For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and performs their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics systems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate.

Those services, too, can benefit from the exemptions from liability, to the extent that they qualify as ‘mere conduit’, ‘caching’ or ‘hosting’ services. (29) Intermediary services span a wide range of economic activities which take place online and that develop continually to provide for transmission of information that is swift, safe and secure, and to ensure convenience of all participants of the online ecosystem. For example, ‘mere conduit’ intermediary services include generic categories of services, such as internet exchange points, wireless access points, virtual private networks, DNS services and resolvers, top-level domain name registries, registrars, certificate authorities that issue digital certificates, voice over IP and other interpersonal communication services, while generic examples of ‘caching’ intermediary services include the sole provision of content delivery networks, reverse proxies or content adaptation proxies. Such services are crucial to ensure the smooth and efficient transmission of information delivered on the internet. Examples of ‘hosting services’ include categories of services such as cloud computing, web hosting, paid referencing services or services enabling sharing information and content online, including file storage and sharing.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Splitting the text in chunks using hierarchical chunking based on headers of html and create embeddings from the chunks of DSA","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# without summarization for now","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load BERT model and tokenizer for cosine similarity\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\n\n# Load SentenceTransformer model for semantic similarity\nsemantic_model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2')\n\n# Function to generate embeddings using BERT for cosine similarity\ndef generate_bert_embedding(text, tokenizer, model):\n    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\", truncation=True, padding=True)\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        outputs = model(**inputs)\n    embedding = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :].numpy()  # [CLS] token embedding\n    return embedding\n\n# Function to calculate cosine similarity\ndef calculate_cosine_similarity(reference_embedding, retrieved_embedding):\n    cosine_sim = np.dot(reference_embedding, retrieved_embedding.T) / (np.linalg.norm(reference_embedding) * np.linalg.norm(retrieved_embedding))\n    return cosine_sim.item()  # Convert from array to scalar\n\n\n# Function to calculate semantic similarity using Sentence-Transformers\ndef calculate_semantic_similarity(reference_text, retrieved_text, model):\n    embeddings1 = model.encode(reference_text, convert_to_tensor=True)\n    embeddings2 = model.encode(retrieved_text, convert_to_tensor=True)\n    similarity = util.pytorch_cos_sim(embeddings1, embeddings2)\n    return similarity.item()\n\n# Reference answers (from your provided code)\nreference_answers = {\n    'gdpr': \"Il diritto degli Stati membri dovrebbe conciliare le norme che disciplinano la libertà di espressione e di informazione, comprese l'espressione giornalistica, accademica, artistica o letteraria, con il diritto alla protezione dei dati personali ai sensi del presente regolamento.

This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation. Transfers should only be allowed where the conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.

(27) This Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules regarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons. (28) The application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and help controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of ‘pseudonymisation’ in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection. (29) In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymisation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller. (30) Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags.\nReference answer: Pseudonymisation involves replacing directly identifiable information with pseudonyms, making it more difficult to identify individuals. However, with additional information, the pseudonym can be linked back to the individual. Anonymisation, on the other hand, involves permanently removing all identifiable information, making it impossible to identify individuals. In other words, pseudonymisation provides a level of privacy protection, while anonymisation ensures complete anonymity.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8374\nSemantic Similarity: 0.4981\n----\n\nSummary for GDPR - Question: How can the principle of transparency be applied to a body responsible for monitoring compliance with a code of conduct?:\ncontroller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures . he should be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation . the measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons . in particular, the controller should have the right to revoke the consent of a third party if the processing is deemed to have been unlawful or unlawful, or if it is necessary to exercise the rights of third parties .\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"7ce15e2642e64fcaa27249266644a28f"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"Your max_length is set to 350, but your input_length is only 302.

That right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller should be able to request that, before the information is delivered, the data subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request relates. (64) The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in particular in the context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests.\nReference answer: Legitimate interest allows for data processing when there is a clear and demonstrable benefit for the data controller, but it must be balanced against the individual's right to data privacy.

The exchange of personal data between public and private actors, including natural persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities in the Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State. (6) Rapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both private companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. Technology has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring a high level of the protection of personal data. (7) Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data.

Such techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate.\nReference answer: The legal implications involve balancing the public interest in security and law enforcement with the individual's fundamental right to privacy and data protection. This requires careful consideration of the system's potential impact on data privacy, the safeguards in place to minimize risks, and the legal framework for regulating the use of such technology to ensure data subject rights are respected and the system operates within legal boundaries.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8208\nSemantic Similarity: 0.2504\n----\n\nSummary for AI_ACT - Question: What are the key principles of administrative law that govern the exercise of regulatory powers by market surveillance authorities?:\nthe right to privacy and protection of personal data must be guaranteed . the principles of data minimisation and data protection by design are applicable . measures taken to ensure compliance may include encryption and anonymisation . technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data may also be used to train AI systems - without the transmission between parties or copying of the raw or structured data themselves - to ensure data privacy and data security by design is not compromised by third parties - or by default - .\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"15b3824ecc81477393863d0b2f64941c"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"Your max_length is set to 350, but your input_length is only 302.

Among the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited generalisability. Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the imbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive nature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and education should be prohibited. That prohibition should not cover AI systems placed on the market strictly for medical or safety reasons, such as systems intended for therapeutical use.

(8) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. Those rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights, supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling a European ecosystem of public and private actors creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the Union.\nReference answer: The EU has broad powers to establish rules in areas of common interest, including the establishment of interoperability between its information systems to facilitate cooperation and achieve shared goals.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8550\nSemantic Similarity: 0.5678\n----\n\nSummary for AI_ACT - Question: What are the legal implications of a notifying authority confirming that no certificates relevant to a suspension will be issued, amended, or re-issued during the suspension period?:\na notifying authority has confirmed there is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights . no certificates relevant to the suspension will be issued, amended or re-issued . if the notified body does not have the capacity to support existing certificates issued, it must continue to monitor them . the provider of the system covered by the certificate shall confirm in writing to the national competent authorities of the Member State in which it has its registered place of business if it is temporarily assuming the functions .\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"c41a669d7c414b40bd92303afeab201c"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"Your max_length is set to 350, but your input_length is only 292.

This is especially relevant in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks.

Such techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate.\nReference answer: The use of such a system would raise significant concerns about due process and fairness in legal proceedings, as it potentially relies on a single source of data without independent verification or human oversight.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8007\nSemantic Similarity: 0.3448\n----\n\nSummary for AI_ACT - Question: What are the potential legal challenges related to using AI systems to determine access to social security benefits?:\nthe impact of the use of AI tools on the defence rights of suspects should not be ignored . the accuracy, non-discriminatory nature and transparency of the AI systems are important to guarantee respect for the rights of the affected persons . in particular, their rights to free movement, protection of private life and personal data, international protection and good administration should be respected . a spokesman for the u.s. embassy in london said that the embassy would not be able to respond to requests for comment\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"688fb9f261a5476f99a4384f74b088e0"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"Your max_length is set to 350, but your input_length is only 290.

Voluntary actions should not be used to circumvent the obligations of providers of intermediary services under this Regulation. (27) Whilst the rules on liability of providers of intermediary services set out in this Regulation concentrate on the exemption from liability of providers of intermediary services, it is important to recall that, despite the generally important role played by such providers, the problem of illegal content and activities online should not be dealt with by solely focusing on their liability and responsibilities. Where possible, third parties affected by illegal content transmitted or stored online should attempt to resolve conflicts relating to such content without involving the providers of intermediary services in question. Recipients of the service should be held liable, where the applicable rules of Union and national law determining such liability so provide, for the illegal content that they provide and may disseminate to the public through intermediary services.

If the design intentionally misleads users or restricts their ability to make informed decisions, it could raise concerns under consumer protection laws and potentially result in legal consequences.\nCosine Similarity: 0.8611\nSemantic Similarity: 0.4506\n----\n\nSummary for DSA - Question: What are the legal implications of a party failing to comply with a request for data pursuant to a legal framework?:\nproviders of online platforms should be required to provide for internal complaint-handling systems . systems should enable all recipients of the service to lodge a complaint . complaints should not set formal requirements such as referral to specific, relevant legal provisions or elaborate legal explanations . providers should be able to use the complaint mechanism to contest the decision of the provider on their notices if they consider that the action taken by that provider was not adequate . a spokesman for the slovak ministry of justice said that a review of the\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"a08fa7a218334add89fc08aa18028700"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"Your max_length is set to 350, but your input_length is only 262.

Therefore, providers of online platforms should be required to provide for internal complaint-handling systems, which meet certain conditions that aim to ensure that the systems are easily accessible and lead to swift, non-discriminatory, non-arbitrary and fair outcomes, and are subject to human review where automated means are used.

(2) Member States are increasingly introducing, or are considering introducing, national laws on the matters covered by this Regulation, imposing, in particular, diligence requirements for providers of intermediary services as regards the way they should tackle illegal content, online disinformation or other societal risks. Those diverging national laws negatively affect the internal market, which, pursuant to Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods and services and freedom of establishment are ensured, taking into account the inherently cross-border nature of the internet, which is generally used to provide those services. The conditions for the provision of intermediary services across the internal market should be harmonised, so as to provide businesses with access to new markets and opportunities to exploit the benefits of the internal market, while allowing consumers and other recipients of the services to have increased choice. Business users, consumers and other users are considered to be ‘recipients of the service’ for the purpose of this Regulation.\nReference answer: Harmonized rules aim to create a consistent and unified legal framework within the internal market, facilitating trade, competition, and the free movement of goods and services.

Voluntary actions should not be used to circumvent the obligations of providers of intermediary services under this Regulation. (27) Whilst the rules on liability of providers of intermediary services set out in this Regulation concentrate on the exemption from liability of providers of intermediary services, it is important to recall that, despite the generally important role played by such providers, the problem of illegal content and activities online should not be dealt with by solely focusing on their liability and responsibilities. Where possible, third parties affected by illegal content transmitted or stored online should attempt to resolve conflicts relating to such content without involving the providers of intermediary services in question. Recipients of the service should be held liable, where the applicable rules of Union and national law determining such liability so provide, for the illegal content that they provide and may disseminate to the public through intermediary services. Where appropriate, other actors, such as group moderators in closed online environments, in particular in the case of large groups, should also help to avoid the spread of illegal content online, in accordance with the applicable law.\nReference answer: The \"mere conduit\" concept generally exempts intermediary service providers from liability for content transmitted through their services if they do not actively contribute to or modify the content.

To this end, they should, where appropriate, conduct their risk assessments and design their risk mitigation measures with the involvement of representatives of the recipients of the service, representatives of groups potentially impacted by their services, independent experts and civil society organisations. They should seek to embed such consultations into their methodologies for assessing the risks and designing mitigation measures, including, as appropriate, surveys, focus groups, round tables, and other consultation and design methods. In the assessment on whether a measure is reasonable, proportionate and effective, special consideration should be given to the right to freedom of expression.\nReference answer: Failing to ensure that compliance officers are qualified and competent may result in ineffective compliance practices, leading to potential breaches, violations, and ultimately, legal consequences.
